# Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator 

## Description
This challenge requires the development of a command-line application that generates a professional looking README.md file. When the use is prompted for information about the user's application respository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated. The README.md will have the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. When the user enters the title of the project, it is displayed as the title of the README.md. When the description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions are entered, that information is added to the sections of the README.mc entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests. 

There will be a list of license choices for the user from a list of options, and once chosen, the license appears as a badge that is added near the top of the README.md with a notice that is added to the section of the README.md entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under. The user's GitHub username will be added to the section of the README.md entitled Questions, with a link to the user's GitHub profile. The user's email will be added to the section of the README.md entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach the user with additional questions. When the links in the Table of Contents is clicked, the user will be taken to the corresponding section of the README.md.
